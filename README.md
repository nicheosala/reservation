# Reservation

This is a smart contract for managing the booking of an apartment.
In short, by implementing a typical functionality on the blockchain such as free cancellation of a reservation, the need to place one's trust in services such as Booking or AirBnb would be eliminated, favoring a direct financial relationship between the buyer and the owner of the apartment.
For the owner of an apartment it would mean eliminating or at least reducing the fees to be paid for the aforementioned services, with a clear economic advantage, while the buyer could make reservations with greater carefree.
